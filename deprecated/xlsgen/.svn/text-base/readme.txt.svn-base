Windows 9X/NT/2K/XP. 10MB free on your hard drive.

An internet connection to create a license file (.lic)


7) Trial version / Buying the product

The trial version will pop up a message box everytime an Excel spreadsheet is 
created and adds a "Trial Version" label in each worksheet. 
The trial version can be promoted to a full developer license by 
starting up the "Buy Online.exe" executable and proceeding to buy the product. 
Upon payment receipt, enter your license number in the registration code 
field of the "Buy Online.exe" executable, and you are licensed. Thanks.

The first time the product is run, it requires the creation of a trial license 
file (.lic). This step is done by connecting to the xlsgen website, on a special 
webpage.
