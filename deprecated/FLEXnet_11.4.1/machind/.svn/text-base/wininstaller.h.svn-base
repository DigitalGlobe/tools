 NAME:          fnpActSvcInstallWin

 DESCRIPTION:   Called to installed (or upgrade existing) system files.
                Should be called even if you want to register an interest in the 
                services and must be paired with an UnInstall.

 PARAMETERS:    None

 RETURNS:       BOOL - TRUE = Success, FALSE = Look at error code.
                call fnpActSvcGetLastErrorWin for addition return information.
                Valid fnpActSvcGetLastErrorWin codes are:
                FNP_INSTALL_NOEXTENDEDINFO
                FNP_INSTALL_UPGRADED

 NAME:          fnpActSvcUninstallWin

 DESCRIPTION:   Called to uninstall your use of the services. 
                Using a reference counter it determines if the services 
                should be removed from the system.

 PARAMETERS:    None

                call fnpActSvcGetLastErrorWin for addition return information.
                Valid fnpActSvcGetLastErrorWin codes are:

                NOTE: Returning TRUE with FNP_INSTALL_NOEXTENDEDINFO as an
                      extended error indicates that other products are installed
