		FLEXnet Licensing Examples			

This directory contains several sub-directories with example 
license files and code.  

 
    advanced      - Advanced examples, including:
                    exinstal.c  -- example license installer 
                                   program
                    get_dir.c   -- gets directory in $PATH 
                                   command is in; useful for default 
                                   license file location
                    licstring.c -- sample licensed application that
                                   incorporates a "license in a buffer"
                    ls_co_ex.c  -- vendor-daemon checkout

    c#            - C sharp example interfacing to FLEXnet Licensing.
 
    child         - Child process which checks out a license and 
                    communicates status with parent.  Optional 
                    encryption of traffic with parent.  A possible 
                    solution for Unix programs that cannot use SIGALRM, 
                    but need regular heartbeats.
    composite     - Composite Hostid source examples.

    licenses      - Example licenses, useful for lmcrypt
    trivial       - Example FLEXenabled application using the Trivial API
    simple        - Example FLEXenabled application using the Simple API

    vb            - FLEXnet Licensing client API implemented as wrapper 
                    functions
                    for use by Visual Basic licenses applications.
                    Examples are  provided for VB v3.0, v4.0, v6.0, and
                    vb.NET.

    vendor_hostid - Example of vendor-defined hostid code.

    vendor_info   - Example of accessing vendor specific information
                    via the lc_get_attr(job, LM_A_VD_FEATINFO...)
                    FLEXible API function.
        
These examples are intended to provide instruction in the 
use of various FLEXnet Licensing features. They are unsupported and
may not exist in future FLEXnet Licensing toolkits.
While we have made every effort to insure that these examples are 
correct, they are not intended to be release-quality debugged 
products.

In addition to the files in this directory,
FLEXenabled application examples are provided in the machind
directory of the Licensing toolkit:


     <install_dir>/flexlm/<version>/machind (UNIX)
     C:/Program Files/flexlm/<version>/machind (Windows)
