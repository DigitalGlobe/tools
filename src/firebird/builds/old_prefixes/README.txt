Hi Folks

This is the old makefile area, left over from the InterBase unix build 
procedures.  They have been replaced in src/make.new with an autoconfig
version.

The prefix.xxxx files have been left here since they often formed the basis 
of platform specific options, for those keen to port firebird2 back to some
of those platforms.
