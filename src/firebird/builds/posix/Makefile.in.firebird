###########  Build process overview  #################################
#
#  Firebird2 has brought with it a new build process.  This extended
#    comment should help explain that process.  Keep in mind there are
#    a number of artifacts left in the makefiles from the previous build
#    processes.
#
#  The build process starts by building a bootstrap version of gpre.
#    This is possible because of a special version of gpre_meta.cpp,
#    gpre_meta_boot.cpp.  It is a copy of the gpre_meta.epp file with all
#    the embeded commands removed.  There are pregenerated copy of the
#    iberror.h and related files in the source tree.  These are used for the
#    entire build process.  In the future we should check for the ability
#    to regenerate iberror.h and friends (ie, a working FB install) and only
#    use the static files as a last resort.
#
#  The bootstrap version of gpre (gpre_boot) is used to build all the
#    engine files, except security.bin.  security.epp requires the security
#    database which is not available at this time.  The code in jrd/alt.cpp
#    that references the functions in security.bin has been #ifdef'ed out.
#    During this phase of the build process the limited version of alt.bin
#    is used.  The full version of alt.bin is compiled later in the build
#    process after the security database is available.  After the
#    (hopefully pending) redesign of FB security the security database
#    dependancies should go away.
#
#  The engine objects are placed in the jrd_static.a archive.  This archive
#    contains all the objects needed to create statically linked programs.
#    A fully functional version of gpre, gpre_static, is then generated
#    using jrd_static.a.  I choose to statically link the few utilities
#    required to build FB to avoid possible shared library symbol conflicts.
#
#  All of the aforementioned work is done in the
#    first phase of the compilation.  I called it the first phase because
#    none of the work (except iberror.h and friends) requires database access.
#    Phase 2 builds all the tools necessary to compile the rest of FB.  Those
#    tools are gbak and the gds.$(SHRLIB_EXT) shared library.
#
#  The .epp files in gbak require the yachts.lnk database.  But the only
#    thing the database is used for is the metadata, so an empty database
#    will do the job.  The create_db program is a small c API utility that
#    creates an empty database.  This utility is statically linked.
#    Once there is an empty database gbak_static is built.  gbak_static is
#    used later on in the compilation process to restore build databases.
#
#  After gbak_static is built the gds.$(SHRLIB_EXT) library is built.  This library is
#    still missing the security functionality.
#
#  Now we are on phase 3, building the actual DB tools.  This is as expected.
#    We build all tools and link them against the shared library, including
#    gpre, gbak, and the fully functional gds.$(SHRLIB_EXT).
#
# John Belardo ~ July 2001
#
# In the tradition of makefiles, they have evolved even further.  But most of 
# the above is still applies.  There now tends to be a Makefile for each 
# target rather than the more traditional Makefile per directory model.
# This was needed to enable super to build corrently.  But it also allowed
# some of the boot build process to be done simpler as well.
# MOD 28-July-2002
