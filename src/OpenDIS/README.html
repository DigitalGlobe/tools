<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
This directory contains the C++ code to implement the
Distributed
Interactive Simulation (DIS) IEEE-1278 standard, which is often used in
military simulations.<br>
<br>
The C++ code consists of two portions. The protocol
code itself consists of classes that represent Protocol Data Units
(PDUs). These classes have fields, getters, and setters, and are able
to marshal and unmarshal themselves to and from the DIS binary format.
The Java implementation can also marshal itself to XML and Java
serialization format. This code was automatically generated via XMLPG,
a tool that generates
Java, CSharp, Objective C, and C++ code automatically from an XML description. The
generated code is in the cpp directory. <br>
<br>
The second portion of the code is supporting classes that read and
write PDUs from the network, log PDUs to a file, and more. These are
essentially example files that demonstrate the use of the generated DIS
code. The cpp code for this is in CppUtils and Example. Unit tests are 
in the UnitTestDIS directory. Make files and project files were automatically
generated, and reside in the Compile directory. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">XML Description File</span><br>
<br>
An XML file that is an abstract description of the protocol classes is
in DIS1998.xml. This file is used by XML Multi-Language Protocol
Generator
(XMLPG), which is available at the sourceforge site for download. <br>
<br>
The XML file is processed by XMLPG and writes the  C++
protocol code. The idea is to use the XMLPG tool to get the final
product "close", and then manually modify the source code in subversion
to tweak the last bit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">C++</span><br>
<br>
The C++ code is in the Cpp directory. The prefab C++ implemenation uses
the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIS</span>
namespace to contain the protocol code. The Compile directory contains
Microsoft Visual C++ build files, which allows the code to be compiled
and linked to a dll or executable. The CppUtils directory contains
supporting files for the DIS protocol, including a data stream class
for marshaling and unmarshaling, a factory class, and some simple
example code that generates Entity State PDUs. Simple unit test code is
also available in the UnitTestDIS directory.<br>
<br>
* Automated patch application. The Unix patch utility is used to modify
the auotmatically generated code. See the patch directory in the
open-dis
directory. Patches are applied via the ant task "patch". Windows
users&nbsp; need to install cygwin utilities to be able to use patch,
and make some minor changes to the ant build.xml file.<br>
