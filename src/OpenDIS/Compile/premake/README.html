  <title>How to use the Premake files.</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>We are providing Premake files so that you can reproduce the build systems.</p>
  <p>To do this, engage Premake on the command line, as many of the .bat and .sh files will show.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, for the produced CodeBlocks files, modifications needed to be made because of bugs that appear in Linux, which are the fault of CodeBlocks or Premake.</p>
