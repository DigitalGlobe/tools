  <title>DIS: Compiling the generated source files.</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>So far, this really only applies to the C++ users since the results of the Java compile are distributed in this package.</p>
  <p>Your options include using:
   <ul>
    <li>the Ant task.</li>
    <li>the distributed MSVC project files.</li>
    <li>the premake project definitions.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>There exists an Ant task that can be executed at the top directory using the build.xml file with Ant.</p>
  <p>For your convenience, the authors are distributing the MSVC project files.</p>
  <p>You can use <a href="http://premake.sourceforge.net">Premake</a> to generate another build system.  This is done by:
   <ul>
    <li>Downloading Premake</li>
    <li>Using the provided .bat files provided in the DIS/Compile/premake directory</li>
    <li>Using your own command-line usage of the Premake utility to generate another build system.</li>
   </ul>
   Premake will generate the project build files in the directory specified by the (Lua) project description file, which states they should be created at DIS/Compile/target.
