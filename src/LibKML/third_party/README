For KMZ reading we use the minizip contrib package that comes with zlib (see
DEPENDENCIES). To avoid compiling third-party sources into our code, we build
minizip as a separate library.

There are some local modifications to the minizip code to avoid symbol clashes
with other projects that might statically link both libkml and its
dependencies with other libraries dependent on minizip. These can be seen by
diffing r655 with r656.

There are several modifications to the uriparser code to avoid compiler
warnings on some recent flavors of GCC. Diff these revisions for details:
r706 : r705 (strict initialization)
r714 : r713 (free called on const pointer)
* make code buildable by crosstool v16, fixed URI_INLINE declaration
* removed URI_INLINE directive from functions that should not be inlined (e.g.
  used before they are defined).

There are several changes to zlib-1.2.3/minizip to silence unitialized
warnings.  These are true positives and should be backported upstream.
See cl/17289029.
