<!-- This is a snippet of malformed KML found in the wild. The coordinates in
the LineString are not separated by spaces, as required by the KML standard.
However, Google Earth has always treated a,b,c,d,e,f coordinate strings as if
they were lng,lat,alt tuples separated by commas. libkml emulates this
forgiving interpretation. -->
