This Xcode project has two targets:
  - An OS X Framework directly usable as an embedded Framework in other Xcode
    projects.
  - A static library, suitable for programs that cannot link dynamically with
    libkml (e.g. iPhone projects).

The static library is self-explantory.

The standard installation path for an OS X Framework created in Xcode is:
$(HOME)/Library/Frameworks

To enable an embeddable Framework, the installation path in this project is
set to: @executable_path/../Frameworks

For more information on this, see:
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Tasks/CreatingFrameworks.html

A traditional Framework has all its header files in a single Headers
directory in the Framework bundle. Since libkml has its header files spread
throughout multiple levels of directory hierarchy, there is some extra
manipulation necessary in order for all include paths to be satisfied. If you
want to see the gory details, see the "Run Script" build phase of the LibKML
target. However, as an end user of the Framework all you need to do is:
#include <LibKml/LibKml.h>.

The Xcode project was made with Xcode 3.1.3 on OS X 10.5.8
