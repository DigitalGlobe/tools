Support for PHP in SWIG is still under development. If you would like to use
the SWIG-generated PHP5 wrapper file, you will first have to run our
tweak_generated_kmldom.php script. This will copy the generated kmldom.php
script from the build directory and apply two necessary fixes:
- namespace issues
- "empty" is a reserved keyword in PHP. SWIG will attempt to use this in
  its wrapping of the std::vector class. We rename it to _empty(). If you
  want to call it in your application, you must use $foo->_empty();
See the tweak script for more details.

TODO: we may remove raw vectors from the API.

PHP 5 (since 5.2.5 ) does not permit module extensions to be loaded from paths
that contain directory names (see PHP bug 44037:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44037 ). This means that you can't use any
path-munging hacks to execute extensions in local directories.

To run these examples, you should copy the kmldom extension module to your
PHP extension directory. You can discover what your extension directory is by
executing this command in a terminal:
php-config --extension-dir

The extension module is built under the main project build directory:
../../build/php/kmldom

Be sure the the extension is world-readable before you copy.

(An alternative is to supply a custom extension directory via your php.ini.)
