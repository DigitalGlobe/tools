QGIS server
==================================================

QGIS server allows you to publish your QGIS projects as Web Map
Services (WMS). Simply layout your map in QGIS. The WMS will look
exactly the same, because QGIS server uses the same libraries for
rendering, as the desktop application does.

A sample configuration file for Httpd is installed under
/etc/httpd/conf.d/qgis-server.conf.

This configuration expects QGIS project files under /var/www/wms. To
use it, reload the Httpd configuration and place the files you want to
publish in this directory.

A getCapabilities request looks like this:

http://localhost/wms/my_qgis_project?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=1.3.0

QGIS project is "/var/www/wms/my_qgis_project.qgs". The sample
configuration automatically adds the project file extension for you.

The actual data can stay where it is. Make sure QGIS server can
access the project file and don't forget to let Httpd reload its
configuration before sending your requests!

Please fill in the metadata tab for your QGIS project.

You can easily test your WMS by adding it as a WMS layer in QGIS.

==================================================

The traditional QGIS server configuration is less comfortable and
I don't encourage it, unless you have a good reason to use it:

This approach only allows for a single map service.

It uses two configuration files, that must be located in the same
directory as the FCGI binary:

 - admin.sld
 - wms_metadata.xml

"admin.sld" uses extended SLD syntax (Style Layer Descriptor) to
describe symbolization of data.

"wms_metadata.xml" supplies metadata for your WMS. You may also use this
file with the kind of configuration mentioned on top. But if you want to
serve different projects, and metadata varies between them, that file
won't work for you. Please see above for how to define project specific
metadata!

Both configuration files are included as documentation.
