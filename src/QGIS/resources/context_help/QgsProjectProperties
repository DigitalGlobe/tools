<h3>Project Properties</h3>
<p>
  This dialog allows you to set a number of properties related to the
  <label>Project</label>. A Project is a saved set of layers and their settings,
  as well as other information required to restore the project from disk.

  <td><label>Project&nbsp;title</label></td>

    <p>
      A descriptive title for the project. This title will be displayed in the
      title bar of the QGIS window.

      Selected features are displayed on the map using this color.

  <td>
    <p>
      Reference files by their absolute path or a path relative to the project
      file.  If you are sharing your project file with others, or accessing it
      from another machine, choose "relative".

  <td>
    <p>
      Which ellipsoid should be used to calculate distances when using 'on the
      fly' CRS transformation.

<tr>
  <td><label>Canvas&nbsp;units</label></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Choose the units appropriate for the layers in the project.

<tr>
  <td><label>Precision</label></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Use the manual setting to set the precision of the display in the status
      bar. As the mouse is moved over the map canvas, the coordinates are updated and
      displayed in the status bar using the precision you choose. Automatic (the
      default) results in a default precision based on the map units.
    </p>

<tr>
  <td><label>Digitizing</label></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      The option <label>Enable topological editing</label> enables editing and
      maintaining common boundaries in polygon mosaics. Editing a vertex in shared
      boundary will result in updating both boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid digitizing all vertices of the common boundary select
      <label>Avoid intersections of new polygons</label>. In the dialog window
      tick appropriate layers to which the new polygon will be adjusted. Draw
      the new polygon in the way it overlap the existing one, it will be cut
      automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>Snapping options</label> allows you to set the snapping tolerance
      in pixels or map units and the snapping mode: <label>to vertex</label>,
      <label>to segment</label>, <label>to vertex and segment</label> for every
      layer separately.

<h4>Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Tab</h4>
</a>

<p>
  The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) tab allows you to set the projection for
  the current project and enable on the fly transformation. You do not need to
  have a saved project to setup and enable 'on the fly' CRS transformation.
</p>
<p>
  To use 'on the fly' CRS transformation, click the <label>Enable 'on the fly'
  CRS transformation</label> check box. Then choose the projection for the
  project (map canvas) from the list of Geographic or Projected coordinate
  systems.
</p>
<p>
  You can find a coordinate system by entering its name, EPSG code or the QGIS ID
  into the <label>Filter</label> text field. The list of recently used
  coordinate systems are available at the top for quick access.
</p>

<a name="layers">
<h4>Identify layers Tab</h4>
</a>
<p>
  On this tab you can choose on which layers the identify tool will work.
