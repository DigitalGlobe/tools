    /**
     * Create an instance of SGSocket.
     *
     * When calling the constructor you need to provide a host name, a
     * port number, and a socket style. The convention used by the
     * SGSocket class is that the server side listens and the client
     * side sends. For a server socket, the host name should be
     * empty. For a server, the port number is optional, if you do not
     * specify a port, the system will assign one. For a client
     * socket, you need to specify both a destination host and
     * destination port. For both client and server sockets you must
     * specify the socket type. Type must be either udp or tcp. Here's
     * a quick breakdown of the major differences between UDP and TCP
     * type sockets.
     *
     * TCP sockets are the type where you establish a connection and
     * then can read and write to the socket from both ends. If one
     * end of TCP socket connect quits, the other end will likely
     * segfault if it doesn't take special precautions.  But, the nice
     * thing about TCP connections is that the underlying protocol
     * guarantees that your message will get through. This imposes a
     * certain performance overhead though on the communication
     * because the protocol must resend failed messages. TCP sockets
     * are good for sending periodic command/response type messages
     * where performance isn't a big issues, but reliability is.
     *
     * UDP sockets on the other hand are a lower level protocol and
     * don't have the same sort of connection as TCP sockets. With UDP
     * sockets, the server end just sits and listens for incoming
     * packets from anywhere. The client end sends it's message and
     * forgets about it. It doesn't care if there isn't even a server
     * out there listening and all the packets are getting
     * lost. Although systems/networks usually do a pretty good job
     * (statistically) of getting your UDP packets to their
     * destination, there is no guarantee that any particular packet
     * will make it. But, because of this low level implementation and
     * lack of error checking, UDP packets are much faster and
     * efficient. UDP packets are good for sending positional
     * information to synchronize two applications. In this case, you
     * want the information to arrive as quickly as possible, and if
     * you lose a packet, you'd rather get new updated information
     * rather than have the system waste time resending a packet that
     * is becoming older and older with every retry.
     * @param host name of host if direction is SG_IO_OUT or SG_IO_BI
     * @param port port number if we care to choose one.
     * @param style specify "udp" or "tcp"
