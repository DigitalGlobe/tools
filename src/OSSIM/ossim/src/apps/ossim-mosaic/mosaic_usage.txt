This application allows one to construct a mosaic from an input file list.
The mosaic application can take a keywordlist or specifiy all the input files on
the command line: Below you will see an example of a keyword list and without a
keyword list.

I. USING THE KEYWORD LIST TO GENERATE A MOSAIC



EXAMPLE KEYWORDLIST START:

file1.filename: /data/aa4/drb/ossim_regression_test/emerge/utm_geotiff/17184_20001208_tile1.tif
file2.filename: /data/aa4/drb/ossim_regression_test/emerge/utm_geotiff/17184_20001208_tile2.tif
file3.filename: /data/aa4/drb/ossim_regression_test/emerge/utm_geotiff/17184_20001208_tile3.tif

// :
// :
// fileN: <full path and file name to the Nth file in the list>

// currently this option has been tested
// with ossimTiffWriter and ossimJpegWriter
// writer.type: ossimTiffWriter
// writer.filename: <full path to output file>

// Currently, the mosaic application supports
// SIMPLE mosaics (ie. no blending algorithms)
// FEATHER mosaic or
// BLEND

mosaic.type: SIMPLE

// product type and projection information
// is optional.  It will use the first images
// geometry information instead.
// the type is the class name. Go into the projections/map_projections directory
// product.type:
// product.meters_per_pixel_y: 
// product.meters_per_pixel_x: 
// product.central_meridian:   
// product.origin_latitude: 
// product.zone:
// product.std_parallel_1:
// product.std_parallel_2:
// product.scale_factor:
// product.false_easting:
// product.false_northing:



EXAMPLE KEYWORDLIST END


then execute:

ossim-mosaic -k <keywordlist> -o <optional output file name>

Note: the <keywordlist> is an filename with the above options
      the <optional output file name> is the output file the mosaic is
          written to.  Note: I only support geotiff write now.



II. USING NO KEYWORDLIST TO GENERATE A MOSAIC


EXAMPLE OF MOSAICING COMMAND LINE WITHOUT KEYWORDLIST

ossim-mosaic -m <optional mosaic type> -o <output file name> -i <file1> <file2> <file3> .... <fileN>


Note:

1. <optional mosaic type> can be 1) SIMPLE, 2) BLEND, 3) FEATHER

2. the list of files you wish to mosaic must be last.  Notice you don't have the 
ability to change projections like you did with the keyword list.  The default
output projection is the first image in the list that is a map projection.



III TIPS AND TRICKS


1) How can I use mosaic application to quickly mosaic a number of images
   in a given directory without hand typing the images in.

  Under unix based systems we can capture the output of one program and
  feed it as input into another:  Go to the directory that has all the images
  you wish to mosaic and then issue the following:

  ossim-mosaic -o ./output.tif -i `ls *.tif`

  this will feed all images with a .tif extnesion into the mosaic app
  and output a geotif file called output.tif.


2) What if the files are in separate directories

  ossim-mosaic -o ./output.tif -i `find . -name "*.tif"`

will scan all subdirectories and feed the output as input to the mosaic application.
