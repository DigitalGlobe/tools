    \title Using SocketCAN Plugin

    \brief Overview of how to use the SocketCAN plugin.

    The SocketCAN plugin encapsulates the Linux sockets API for accessing the CAN devices.
    This API is a set of open source CAN drivers and a networking stack contributed by
    Volkswagen Research to the Linux kernel.

    \section1 SocketCAN usage

    To list all (including unconfigured) network interfaces, the command
    \c{ifconfig -a} can be used.

    To use SocketCAN, the corresponding Linux Kernel modules must be loaded
    and the network interface must be configured.

    \section2 Setting up real CAN hardware

    This section assumes, that the device driver is already loaded
    (most likely automatically when connecting the CAN hardware).

    To set the device can0 to a bitrate of 250 kBit/s:
    \code
        sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 250000
        sudo ip link set up can0
    \endcode

    \section2 Setting up a virtual CAN bus

    \note For CAN FD usage, the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) has to be set
    to 72 byte.

    \code
        sudo modprobe vcan
        sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
        sudo ip link set vcan0 mtu 72
        sudo ip link set up vcan0
    \endcode

    The command line test programs used in the following are from
    the \l{https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils}{can-utils} package:

    \code
        # Display received CAN messages
        candump vcan0

        # Send a CAN message
        cansend vcan0 123##3112233445566778899aabbccddeeff

        # Generate random CAN messages
        cangen vcan0
    \endcode

    \section1 Creating CAN Bus Devices

    At first it is necessary to check that QCanBus provides the desired plugin:

    \code
        if (QCanBus::instance()->plugins().contains(QStringLiteral("socketcan"))) {
            // plugin available
        }
    \endcode

    Where \e socketcan is the plugin name.

    Next, a connection to a specific interface can be established:

    \code
        QCanBusDevice *device = QCanBus::instance()->createDevice(
            QStringLiteral("socketcan"), QStringLiteral("can0"));
        device->connectDevice();
    \endcode

    Where \e can0 is the active CAN interface name. CAN interfaces act like regular
    network interfaces on Linux systems and can be discovered using \c ifconfig.

    The device is now open for writing and reading CAN frames:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame;
        frame.setFrameId(8);
        QByteArray payload("A36E");
        frame.setPayload(payload);
        device->writeFrame(frame);
    \endcode

    The reading can be done using the \l {QCanBusDevice::}{readFrame()} method. The
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{framesReceived()} signal is emitted when at least one new frame
    is available for reading:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame = device->readFrame();
    \endcode

    SocketCAN supports the following configurations that can be controlled through
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{setConfigurationParameter()}:

    \table
        \header
            \li Configuration parameter key
            \li Description
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::LoopbackKey
            \li To meet the multiple-user needs, the local loopback is enabled by default.
                This means, whenever a CAN frame is transmitted on the CAN bus, a local
                echo of this frame is sent to all applications connected to this CAN device.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::ReceiveOwnKey
            \li The reception of the CAN frames on the same socket that was sending the CAN frame
                is disabled by default. When enabling this option, all CAN frames sent to the CAN
                bus immediately appear in the receive buffer. This can be used to check if sending
                was successful.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::ErrorFilterKey
            \li A CAN interface driver can generate so called \e {Error Message Frames} that can
                optionally be passed to the user application in the same way as other CAN frames.
                The possible errors are divided into different error classes that may be filtered
                using the appropriate error mask. The values for the error mask are defined in
                \c {linux/can/error.h}.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::RawFilterKey
            \li This configuration can contain multiple filters of type \l QCanBusDevice::Filter.
                By default, the connection is configured to accept any CAN bus message.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::BitRateKey
            \li This configuration is not supported by the socketcan plugin. However
                it is possible to set the rate when configuring the CAN network interface using
                the \c {ip link} command.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::CanFdKey
            \li This configuration option determines whether CANFD frames may be sent or received.
                By default, this option is disabled. It controls the CAN_RAW_FD_FRAMES
                option of the CAN socket.
    \endtable

    For example:

    \snippet snippetmain.cpp SocketCan Filter Example

    Extended frame format and flexible data-rate are supported in SocketCAN.
