    \ingroup datavisualization_qml
    \brief Defines a color gradient.

    A gradient is defined by two or more colors, which will be blended seamlessly.

    The colors are specified as a set of ColorGradientStop child items, each of
    which defines a position on the gradient from 0.0 to 1.0 and a color.
    The position of each ColorGradientStop is defined by setting its
    \l{ColorGradientStop::}{position} property; its color is defined using its
    \l{ColorGradientStop::}{color} property.

    A gradient without any gradient stops falls back to QLinearGradient default,
    which is black at 0.0 and white at 1.0.

    \sa ColorGradientStop
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty list<ColorGradientStop> ColorGradient::stops
    \default

    This property holds the gradient stops describing the gradient.

    By default, this property contains an empty list.

    To set the gradient stops, define them as children of the ColorGradient.
