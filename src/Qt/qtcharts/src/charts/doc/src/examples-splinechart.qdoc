    \section1 Creating Spline Charts

    To create spline charts we need to put our data into QSplineSeries. QSplineSeries automatically
    calculates spline segment control points that are needed to properly draw the spline.

    \snippet splinechart/main.cpp 1

    Now let's add some data points to the series.

    \snippet splinechart/main.cpp 2

    The data series has been populated. To display it on a chart we create a QChart object and add
    the data series to it. We also set the title and the values range on the y-axis, so that our
    chart's visibility is better.

    \snippet splinechart/main.cpp 3

    Then we create a QChartView object with QChart as a parameter. This way we don't need to create
    a QGraphicsView scene ourselves. We also set the Antialiasing on to have the rendered lines
    look nicer.

    \snippet splinechart/main.cpp 4

    Finally, we set the QChartView as the windows's central widget.
