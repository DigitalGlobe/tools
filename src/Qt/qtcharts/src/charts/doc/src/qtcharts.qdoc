    \title Qt Charts C++ Classes

    \brief C++ classes for the Qt Charts API.

    Charts API is built on top of Qt Graphics View Framework. Charts can be displayed as QGraphicsWidget using the QChart class. However
    there is also the convenience class QChartView, which is QWidget based. These enable us to quickly use Qt Charts as a normal Qt widget.

    Each chart type is represented by the QAbstractSeries derived class. To create charts, the users have to use an instance of the related
    series class and add it to a QChart instance.
    \code
    QLineSeries* series = new QLineSeries();
    series->add(0, 6);
    series->add(2, 4);
    ...
    chartView->chart()->addSeries(series);
    chartView->chart()->createDefaultAxes();
    \endcode

    \brief QML types for the Qt Charts API.

    The Qt Charts QML API is an intuitive and simple way to show charts in your QML
    applications.

    Use the following QML to create a simple pie chart:
    \image examples_qmlpiechart.png
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 1
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 2
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 3

    \note Since Qt Creator 3.0 the project created with Qt Quick Application wizard based on
    Qt Quick 2 template uses QGuiApplication by default. As Qt Charts utilizes Qt Graphics View
    Framework for drawing, QApplication must be used. The project created with the wizard is
    usable with Qt Charts after the QGuiApplication is replaced with QApplication.
