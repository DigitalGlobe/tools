    \brief This is a demonstration on how to use a polar chart in your QML application.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Using Polar Charts in Qt Quick Applications

    We begin with a chart that has a spline series and a scatter series with random
    data. Both series use the same axes.

    The next example shows a chart with some accurate historical data for which we need
    to use a DateTimeAxis and a AreaSeries.

    And the final example with a chart that uses a CategoryAxis to make the data easier
    to understand.
