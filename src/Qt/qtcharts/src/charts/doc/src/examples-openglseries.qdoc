    \section1 Enabling OpenGL Acceleration

    To create an OpenGL accelerated series, all you have to do compared to a regular
    series is to set QAbstractSeries::useOpenGL property to \c{true}:

    \snippet openglseries/main.cpp 1

    This makes the chart to instantiate a transparent QOpenGLWidget that is used to draw
    the accelerated series on top of the chart.

    \note The OpenGL acceleration is only supported for QLineSeries and QScatterSeries.
