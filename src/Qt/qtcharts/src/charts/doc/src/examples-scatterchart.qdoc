    \brief The example shows how to create a simple scatter chart.

    \section1 Creating Scatter Charts

    To create scatter charts, a QScatterSeries instance is needed. Here we create a scatter series
    instance, and set the type and width of outline for the scatter points.

    \snippet scatterchart/chartview.cpp 1

    We add the data to be shown. We can use the append() member function or use the stream operator.

    \snippet scatterchart/chartview.cpp 2

    We can define the brush of the scatter series to be an image. Here the image is a star created
    using QPainterPath.

    \snippet scatterchart/chartview.cpp 3

    In the end we enable anti-aliasing, set the chart title, and add the scatter series onto the
    chart. We also disable drop shadow, because it would not look good on an application with only
    chart view shown.

    \snippet scatterchart/chartview.cpp 4

    The image used as a brush for the scatter series may contain several colors. Therefore we need
    to set the desired color explicitly by setting the brush for the legend marker items.

    \snippet scatterchart/chartview.cpp 5

    The chart is ready to be shown.

    \snippet scatterchart/main.cpp 4
