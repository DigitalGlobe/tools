Version

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

Overview

    Allows clients to set the value of a 4x4 uniform to the current texture
    matrix of a stream texture.

    Allows shader access to the texture matrix for the current front buffer
    of a stream texture.  Intended for use with Android SurfaceTexture, which
    doesn't provide the value until the front buffer is latched.

New Procedures and Functions

    The command

       void UniformMatrix4fvStreamTextureMatrixCHROMIUM(
               GLintUniformLocation location,
               GLbooleanFalseOnly transpose,
               const GLfloat* default_value)

    Updates a uniform to match the current stream texture's texture matrix.
    The stream texture must be bound to the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES target on
    the active texture unit.

    If the bound texture is not a stream texture, then the default value is
    used instead.

    <location> Specifies the 4x4f uniform location to be modified.
    <transpose> Specifies whether the matrix should be transposed.
    <default_value> Provides the default matrix.

    The default value is a transitionary step.  It will be removed.

Errors

    None.

New State

    None.
