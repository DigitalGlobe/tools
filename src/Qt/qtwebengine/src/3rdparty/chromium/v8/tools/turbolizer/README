Turbolizer is a HTML-based tool that visualizes optimized code along the various
phases of Turbofan's optimization pipeline, allowing easy navigation between
source code, Turbofan IR graphs, scheduled IR nodes and generated assembly code.

Turbolizer consumes .json files that are generated per-function by d8 by passing
the '--trace-turbo' command-line flag.

Host the turbolizer locally by starting a web server that serves the contents of
the turbolizer directory, e.g.:

cd src/tools/turbolizer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Graph visualization and manipulation based on Mike Bostock's sample code for an
interactive tool for creating directed graphs. Original source is at
