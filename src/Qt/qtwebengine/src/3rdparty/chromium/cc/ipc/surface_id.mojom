// A surface ID is composed of three parts: a namespace, a local ID, and a
// nonce. The local part and nonce are allocated by the client using any scheme
// that avoids duplicates and makes IDs unguessable respectively. The namespace
// is allocated by the service and will be different for each client.
//
// The special id_namespace value 0 is equivalent to the namespace of the
// client. This can be used to create, destroy and submit frames to
// surfaces before learning the namespace and to reference other surfaces
// owned by the same client. The actual id namespace must be used to pass
// surface ids to other clients for them to reference.
