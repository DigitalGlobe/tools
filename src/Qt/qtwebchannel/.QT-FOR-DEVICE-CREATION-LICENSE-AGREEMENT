The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Section shall continue during the Supported Term and for a period of five (5) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement.

The License Fee for a Distribution License purchased by Licensee cannot be refunded or claimed as a credit, even on the ground that it is not distributed, by sale or otherwise, from Licensee to Customers or for any other reason.
Licensee will have an account of Distribution Licenses that will be applied to each copy of Licensed Software that is bundled or integrated with any of the Devices or that is distributed to Customers.  Licensee may bundle, integrate and distribute copies of the Licensed Software so long as Licensee has Distribution Licenses paid for, but not yet used.

13.2 DISTRIBUTION LICENSES ORDERED
Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a “Purchase Order”).

The records shall conform to good accounting practices commonly accepted in the industry and consistently applied.
Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from the end of each calendar quarter, deliver to The Qt Company a report detailing the number of copies of Licensed Software distributed by Licensee during that calendar quarter, and detailing also the number of undistributed copies of Licensed Software made by Licensee and remaining in its account (i.e., undistributed copies for which Distribution Licenses have been or need to be obtained from The Qt Company).

The Sublicensee’s right to use the Sublicensed Software must be limited so that each Sublicense can only be used on a single computer or processor within the possession and control of the Sublicensee. Each Sublicense may not withstanding the foregoing also cover additional computers or processors, but in such case, each additional computer or processor covered by the Sublicense shall require Licensee’s purchase of one additional Distribution license from The Qt Company.

Sublicensee may not be given the right to make any other copies of Licensed Software or Documentation unless and except as permitted by The Qt Company in a separate, written agreement.
