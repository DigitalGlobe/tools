    \title Qt Licensing
    \brief Information about licenses and licensing issues.

    Qt is available under different licensing options designed to accommodate
    the needs of our various users:

    \list
      \li Qt licensed under \e commercial licenses is appropriate for
          development of proprietary/commercial software where you do not want
          to share any source code with third parties or otherwise cannot
          comply with the terms of the GNU LGPL version 3.

      \li Qt licensed under the \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)}
          version 3 is appropriate for the development of Qt applications
          provided you can comply with the terms and conditions of the GNU LGPL
          version 3 (or GNU GPL version 3).
    \endlist

    Qt contains also \l {Licenses Used in Qt}{third-party code} that is licensed
    under specific open-source licenses from the original authors.

    \note For open-source licensed Qt, some specific parts (modules) are not
    available under the GNU LGPL version 3, but under the
    \l {GNU General Public License (GPL)} instead. See
    the list of \l {gpl-licensed-addons}{Qt modules} for details. For commercial
    licensees, all modules are available under a single, commercial Qt
    license.

    \e {Qt documentation} is licensed under the terms of the \l{GNU Free
    Documentation License (FDL)} version 1.3, as published by the Free Software
    Foundation. Alternatively, you may use the documentation in accordance with
    the terms contained in a written agreement between you and The Qt Company.

    \title Licenses Used in Qt
    \brief Information about other licenses and third-party code used in Qt.

    Qt contains some code that is not provided under the
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} or the
    \l{Qt Commercial License}, but rather under specific licenses from the
    original authors.

    The Qt Company gratefully acknowledges these and other contributions to Qt.
    We recommend that programs that use Qt also acknowledge these contributions,
    and quote these license statements in an appendix to the documentation.

    \note You only need to comply with (and acknowledge) the licenses of the
          third-party components that you are using with your application.
          Click the name of the component to see the licensing details.

    \b {Third-party Licenses}
