    The Qt Virtual Keyboard project provides an input framework and reference
    keyboard frontend for Qt 5 on Linux Desktop/X11, Windows Desktop, and
    Boot2Qt targets.

    The input framework makes it easy to write custom input methods or to
    integrate 3rd party input engines. The input methods can be implemented
    in C++ or QML.
