\title Qt Location Esri Plugin
\ingroup QtLocation-plugins

\brief Uses Esri for location services.

\section1 Overview

This geo services plugin allows applications to access
\l {http://www.esri.com}{Esri} location based services using the Qt Location API.
The use of these services is governed by the \l {http://www.esri.com/legal/terms-use}{Esri terms of use}.

Data is provided by \l {http://www.esri.com/data/find-data}{many different content providers}.

The Esri geoservices plugin can be loaded by using the plugin key "esri".

To use the services provided by the Esri platform, a subscription is required. There are two kinds of subscriptions:

\list
    \li \l {https://developers.arcgis.com/plans/}{Developer Subscription}
    \li \l {http://www.arcgis.com/features/plans/pricing.html}{ArcGIS Online Subscription}
\endlist

The Developer subscription offers a free-of-charge option for developing and testing your applications.
With this, your applications can go to production under the following conditions:

\list
    \li The app can request up to one million maps per month, and one million geocodes per month.
    \li The app does not directly generate revenue. That is, end users must be able to obtain it and to use it for free.
\endlist

If the above conditions cannot be met, the ArcGIS Online subscription is the correct choice, as it
gives applications full access to the ArcGIS platform.

\section1 Parameters

\section2 Mandatory parameters

\table
\header
    \li Parameter
    \li Description
\row
    \li esri.token
    \li Security token for using routing services only. Mapping and geocoding services do not require a token.
\endtable

To use the routing services hosted on ArcGIS Online with the Esri plugin, a token is required.
You can \l{https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/accessing-arcgis-online-services/#registering-your-application}{obtain a token for testing purposes},
or you can sign up for an \l {http://www.arcgis.com/features/plans/pricing.html}{ArcGIS Online subscription}.

\section2 Optional parameters

\table
\header
    \li Parameter
    \li Description
\row
    \li esri.useragent
    \li User agent string sent when making network requests
\row
    \li esri.mapping.minimumZoomLevel
    \li The minimum zoom level [double] at which the map is displayed
\row
    \li esri.mapping.maximumZoomLevel
    \li The maximum level [double] at which the map is displayed
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.directory
    \li Absolute path to map tile cache directory used as network disk cache.

    The default place for the cache is \c{QtLocation/here} directory in
    \l {QStandardPaths::writableLocation()} {QStandardPaths::writableLocation}(\l{QStandardPaths::GenericCacheLocation}).
    On systems that have no concept of a shared cache, the application-specific
    \l{QStandardPaths::CacheLocation} is used instead.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.disk.cost_strategy
    \li The cost strategy to use to cache map tiles on disk.
    Valid values are \b bytesize and \b unitary.
    Using \b bytesize, the related size parameter (\b esri.mapping.cache.disk.size) will
    be interpreted as bytes.
    Using \b unitary, they will be interpreted as number of tiles.
    The default value for this parameter is \b bytesize.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.disk.size
    \li Disk cache size for map tiles. The default size of the cache is 50 MiB when \b bytesize is the cost
    strategy for this cache, or 1000 tiles, when \b unitary is the cost strategy.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.memory.cost_strategy
    \li The cost strategy to use to cache map tiles in memory.
    Valid values are \b bytesize and \b unitary.
    Using \b bytesize, the related size parameter (\b esri.mapping.cache.memory.size) will
    be interpreted as bytes.
    Using \b unitary, they will be interpreted as number of tiles.
    The default value for this parameter is \b bytesize.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.memory.size
    \li Memory cache size for map tiles. The default size of the cache is 3 MiB when \b bytesize is the cost
    strategy for this cache, or 100 tiles, when \b unitary is the cost strategy.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.texture.cost_strategy
    \li The cost strategy to use to cache decompressed map tiles in memory.
    Valid values are \b bytesize and \b unitary.
    Using \b bytesize, the related size parameter (\b esri.mapping.cache.texture.size) will
    be interpreted as bytes.
    Using \b unitary, they will be interpreted as number of tiles.
    The default value for this parameter is \b bytesize.
\row
    \li esri.mapping.cache.texture.size
    \li Texture cache size for map tiles. The default size of the cache is 6 MiB when \b bytesize is the cost
    strategy for this cache, or 30 tiles, when \b unitary is the cost strategy.
    Note that the texture cache has a hard minimum size which depends on the size of the map viewport
    (it must contain enough data to display the tiles currently visible on the display).
    This value is the amount of cache to be used in addition to the bare minimum.
\endtable
