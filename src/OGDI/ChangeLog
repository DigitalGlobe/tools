2016-07-07  Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>

    * ogdi/driver/vrf/utils.c: fix stack buffer overflow in vrf_GetMetadata()
    when reading the level in CAT files. Found by GCC 5.2 -faddress=sanitize

2016-07-06  Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>

    * ogdi/include/ecs_util.h: upgrade OGDI_RELEASEDATE to 20160705
    * ogdi/c-api/server.c: fix memory leaks in error code paths of svr_CreateServer()
    * ogdi/c-api/ecsassoc.c: ecs_SetError(): display error message on stderr if memory
    allocation fails.
    * ogdi/driver/vrf/feature.c: add heuristics in vrf_get_ring_coords() to
    detect cycling topology of edges that lead to endless looping and eventually
    crashes. Be robust to memory allocation failures in various places, and
    properly cleanup allocated structures when returning.
    * ogdi/driver/vrf/object.c: implement ecs_SetErrorShouldStop() logic in
    the various _getNext.... methods
    * ogdi/driver/vrf/vrf.c: fix memory leaks in error code paths of dyn_SelectLayer()
    * vpflib/vpfread.c: index_pos(): no longer clamp index values to [1,table.nrows] but
    error out. read_new_row(): be robust to memory allocation failures.
    * vpflib/vpftable.c: vpf_open_table(): be robust to wrong nrows values for
    memory tables.

2016-07-04  Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>

    * Error handling: Add a ecs_SetErrorShouldStop() function that can be
    used internally when the code is able to recover from an error. The user
    may decide if he wants to be resilient on errors by defining OGDI_STOP_ON_ERROR=NO 
    as environment variable (the default being YES: stop on error).
    Add a ecs_SetReportErrorFunction() method to install a custom callback that
    will be called when OGDI_STOP_ON_ERROR=YES so that the user code is still
    aware of errors that occured. If not defined, the error will be logged in stderr.
    * VPF: Avoid a missing fcs file in a coverage to prevent opening any
    coverage of the library (fix opening of DNC17/COA17A dataset) if
    OGDI_STOP_ON_ERROR=NO is defined as environment variable, and otherwise
    better report the error
    * VPF: _getNextObject / _getObject functions: validate the value of the tile_id
    to avoid a potential out-of-bounds read. Fix crash on dqyarea@dqy layer
    of DNC17/H1708311.

2007-05-09  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>

From: Even Rouault <even.rouault@mines-paris.org>
Date: Friday 21:14:18

        * fix filename case sensitivy problems (for Unix-like systems).  

        * fix incorrect use of sprintf in vrf_GetMetadata.

        * report wgs84 instead of nad83, not sure whether that is true 
        for all VPF products, but at least it's correct for VMAP products 
        that *must* be WGS84. A better fix would be to read the VPF table 
        that contains this information.

        * fix a few minor memory leaks and memory usage issues.

        * enable XMIN, YMIN, XMAX and YMAX columns to be of type double 
        in EBR and FBR files (for read the VMAP2i 'MIG2i000' product).

        * add .pjt and .tjt as possible extensions for join tables
        (VMAP2i 'MIG2i000' product).
        
        * fix duplicated layers report (VMAP2i 'MIG2i000' product).
        
        * handle 'L' (Latin1) type for text files (GEOCAPI 'MIGxxx' products).
        
        * optionnaly, convert text to UTF-8 when environment variable 
        CONVERT_OGDI_TXT_TO_UTF8 is defined. This part is not portable 
        on Windows I guess (only tested on Linux) and maybe too specific.
        
        * enable reading of VPF products without table indexes file 
        (GEOCAPI 'MIG013' and 'MIG016' products). VPF norm says that when 
        there is a variable length field in one table, an index should exist, 
        but some test products don't follow this. The approach here is to read 
        the whole table content and build the index in memory.

2007-03-26  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

        * ogdi/glutil/RCa00246 temp file removed, per request from 
	frankie@debiangis. 

============================================================================
2007-02-24  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>

        * Prepare for 3.2.0beta1 release.

2007-02-24  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>

        * Clear olso tilestruct while freeing memory in dyn_freelayerpriv().
        glibc mtrace() reports zero malloc problems now.
        Thanks to djdejohn for the report !

============================================================================
2007-02-12  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>

        * Prepare for 3.1.6 release.
        * add ogdi.pc.in and ogdi-config scripts

2007-02-12  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>
        
        Hide plugins from system libs path: 
  
        * move plugins to $LIB_INST/ogdi subfolder (this is std. now).
        
        * add dlopen patch in c-api for run-time to be able find those 
        plugins for that case that we hided plugins from system wide.
        
        * small typo in ChangeLog.

         We shouldn't expose plugin libs to system wide lib search path,
        this would break FHS, its better to keep them hidden, and only
        ogdi binary handle those.

        * use -soname and mark our exposed library, so exclude plugins.
        
        * libogdi31.so is now libogdi.so.3.1 with libogdi.3 soname.
        but should be findable now with -logdi.

        Release versioning:
          
        - MAJOR releases represents major ABI changes in the exposed shared lib.
        This should not be so offen, only once with major code change wich due
        to a change in how ogdi is called external by other applications.
        - MINOR releases represents revisions or bugfixes over ogdi.

2007-02-12  Balint Cristian  <cbalint@redhat.com>

        * fix some gcc warnings, uninited variables, and unused variables.

2005-02-28  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Prepare for 3.1.5 release.

2004-10-26  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/drivers/vrf/utils.c: the path parsing regex was being freed,
	but then not recompiled if needed again later.  Was breaking some 
	efforts to open a second VRF datasource after the first was closed.

	* README: slight improvements in build explanation.

	* ogdi/contrib/ogdi_info/ogdi_info.c: minor improvements.

2004-10-25  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	the left face id if it is in 'I' format, instead of 'K' format such
	as occurs in the rference layer of VMAP0 products.

	* ogdi/driver/vrf/utils.c: Use short for "buffint" variable.  This is
	the level number used in forming metadata.  This corrects a complaint
	noticed in valgrind.  Likely to cause problems on big endian systems
	as well (crazy level numbers).

	* ogdi/driver/vrf/vrfswq.c: Fixed so that comparisons to string fields
	longer than one character work.  Fixed so that trailing spaces are
	trimmed off string values read from disk before applying comparisons. 

2004-10-19  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/drivers/vrf/object.c: Fixed memory leak for line layers with

	* Release OGDI 3.1.3.

2004-03-29  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/drivers/rpf/utils.c: Check for FSDEVG field is present in 
	TOC file.  As per Bug 917678.

2004-03-26  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/drivers/rpf/rpf.c: Fixed computation of nbfeature in 
	dyn_SelectRegion() as it is unduely sensitive to rounding error issues.
	As per Bug 924250 from Mark Aubin. 

2004-02-19  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/drivers/vrf/vrf.c: fixed serious bug in releaseAllLayers(). 
	Only every other layer was effectively being released resulting in 
	major leaks of file handles and other resources in application 
	accessing multiple layers at once and not explicitly releasing them.

	* vpflib/musedir.c: added some include files to avoid warnings in
	unix builds.

	* ogdi/c-api/client.c: ecs_DestroyServer() now does an ecs_CleanUp() on
	cln_dummy_result to avoid noisy memory leak. 

	* ogdi/drivers/vrf/feature.c: fixed leak of edge_rec.coords memory
	in the bug 741854 fix in vrf_get_ring_coords().

2004-02-18  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* contrib/ogdi_info/ogdi_info.c: use ecs_CleanUp() to free contents
	of result from cln_DestroyClient().  Minor memory leak. 

	* vpflib/strfunc.c: leftjust() - avoid use of strcpy() for overlapping
	string moves.  Reported by Craig Bruce, verified with valgrind. 

=============================================================================

2003-12-15  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* Release OGDI 3.1.2.

	* ogdi/include/ecs_util.h: updated version to 3.1.2.

	properly on MacOS 10.3.  Submitted by Greg Allen.

2003-08-27  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/c-api/ecssplit.c: Modififed ecs_SplitURL() to release
	regular expression resources if called with a NULL url.

	* ogdi/c-api/client.c: Modified cln_DestroyClient() to call
	ecs_SplitURL(NULL) to free static resources.Well, go

	* ogdi/drivers/adrg/utils.c: Fixed problem in _read_adrg(), 
	_read_overview(), and _initRegionWithDefault() such that the files 
	were never closed.  As per bug 795612.

	* ogdi/drivers/adrg/adrg.c: Fixed _releaseAllLayers() so it release
	from the last layer to the first.  It seems that ecs_FreeLayer() 
	now decrements the s->nblayers but didn't use to at some point in the
	distant past.  This bug was discovered while investigating the leaks
	described in sourceforge bug 795612.

2003-05-22  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/driver/vrf/feature.c, utils.c: Fixed several problems related

	and crashes.  

2003-01-29  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/include/ecs_util.h: fixed spelling of length in a few places.

2002-12-18  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* ogdi/include/ecs_util.h: If PI is undefined try to use M_PI.  If
	not available define with much more precision.  As per bug report
	from Craig Bruce.

	* ogdi/include/ecs_util.h: Added the OGDI_VERSION and OGDI_RELEASEDATE
	macros in ecs_util.h.

2001-09-17  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

	* configure.in: don't add /usr/local/lib to LIBS by default.  It
	makes it hard to avoid using stuff from /usr/local.

      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=123132&group_id=11181

	* Query strings passed to VRF driver with double quoted strings
	  wouldn't work properly (ie. contourl@elev(hqc="1")) because
	  one extra character was being eaten by code in vpflib/vpfquery.c.
	  Applied fix suggested by Duncan Chaundy (PCI). 
	
      http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=122597&group_id=11181

	* Added Ecs_tcl_Init() entry point in ecs_tcl.c.  This

Bruno Savard, INFOMAR INC., bsavard@infomar.com, 1998/09/21
Remarks:  -The function svr_BroadCloseLayers() in server.c seems to be useless and 
           it contains the following errors:
              The argument to ecs_OpenDynamicLib should be "ogdi" instead of "ecs".
              The argument passed to ecs_CloseDynamicLib() should be "handle" instead of "func".
              Also, this function does nat have to load the cln_BroadCloseLayer because both
              svr_BroadCloseLayers() and cln_BroadCloseLayers() are in the same library.
          -The function cln_BroadCloseLayers() in client.c seems to be useless.
          -To conclude, I suggest to remove svr_BroadCloseLayers() and cln_BroadCloseLayers() from the core.

          -Both example1 and example2 directories contain example1.c and the makefile to build this example.
           To correct the error, I took the makefile and the example2.c file from the previous core and I copied
           them in the example2 directory of the present core.

	    -The file datadict.h was missing to build the skeleton driver.  I took the one from the previous core.
