3.1.0
=====

Essentially the same as 3.1Beta1.


3.1Beta1
========

 o Implement support for XML Capabilities (as per Proposal 6: Capabilities
   Metadata).  This includes:

     - Added support for reaturning correct capabilities to adrg, dted, rpf
       and vpf drivers. 

     - Added support for parsing capabilities documents, in libogdi utilizing
       Expat (incorporated into the source tree under devdir/external). 

     - Added public client side API for accessing capabilities and version
       information (cln_GetLayerCapabilities(), cln_GetVersion()). 

 o Upgraded VPF driver to support brackets in query expression.  Implemented
   using generic "restricted_where" processor (swq.c).

 o Upgraded ADRG, RPF and DTED drivers to support Image (as well as Matrix)
   family support based on updates supplied by DND. 

 o Added contributed GDAL raster driver as contrib/gdal.

 o Updated zlib in external/zlib to 1.1.3.

 o Embed version number in OGDI shared libraries (eg. libogdi31.so).


3.1Alpha
========

 o Incorporated contrib/ogdi_import, and contrib/ogdi_info sample applications.

 o Updated build system to include configure script, install target, and 
   various cleanups and simplifications.  RPCGEN is no longer run by default.
   External versions of libz and PROJ.4 can be utilized.

 o Updated licenses within source code to reflect the redistributable nature
   of code written by LAS on contract to DND.  

 o Variety of bug fixes, primarily to drivers. 

 o Remove warnings during build from core code.
