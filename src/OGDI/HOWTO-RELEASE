	Notes on Preparing an OGDI Source Release
	=========================================

1) Ensure the OGDI_VERSION and OGDI_RELEASEDATE values are up to date in
   ogdi/include/ecs_util.h.

2) Update OGDI_MINOR OGDI_MAJOR and OGDI_VERSION in configure.in for
   proper soname versioning of libraries. Run autoconf to regenerate
   configure script.

3) Do complete test builds on several platforms - at least Linux, 
   Solaris, and Windows NT.  

4) Run testsuite on these platforms. 

5) Add release notice in devdir/ChangeLog.

6) Update the NEWS file based on a digested form of the ChangeLog file.

7) If this is a major public release, apply a tag to the source for
   the release.  Normally tags are not incorporated for alpha and beta
   releases to avoid tag pollution. 

   ie. 

   cd devdir
   cvs tag ogdi_3_1_0

8) Create the source distributions using the mkogdidist.sh script.  The
   version name should include subrelease name components as appropriate.
   Hit enter when prompted for a CVS password.

   ie. 
   cd devdir
   mkogdidist.sh 3.1beta2

9) Publish the resulting files.  For public (ie. final) releases they should
   be put up on the SourceForge file download manager area.

10) Announce release.  For public releases announce to ogdidev mailing list,
   and on Freshmeat.net.
