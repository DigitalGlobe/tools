	OGDI / ZLIB README
	==================


This directory contains the ZLIB 1.1.4 source release code.  Only the
core ZLIB code has been preserved, various contributed utilities and
so forth have been omitted.  

The nt/zlib.cnt DLL def file has been renamed zlib.def, and the only change
has been to remove the DLL name so the makefile can force it to be based
on the OGDI version.  Otherwise the DLL should be entry point compatible with
a generic 1.1.3 zlib build.
