This directory contains the Aqua library (libaqua), version 1.0-pre-3.


**** THIS IS A DIRTY SNAPSHOT RELEASE, NOT REALLY USEFUL!  ****

Not all features are completely implemented, the source code is not clean and
lacks documentation. There is no “configure” script neither.


The Aqua library is a C++ library which computes oceanic surface geometry and
normals, suitable for real time or high resolution images rendering. It comes
with a simple OpenGL demo.

It is based on the paper “Realistic simulation of ocean surface using wave
spectra” (in GRAPP 2006 proceedings). See http://www.labri.fr/perso/frechot/.


See the file INSTALL for package requirements and installation instructions.


The Aqua library is free software, distributed under the GNU GPL. See the file
COPYING for copying permission.
