The Aqua library package has been developed and tested using a LFS 6.1
GNU/Linux system (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/), GCC 3.4.3 and
glibc 2.3.4.


To install the package, you need several other packages:

- FFTW, The fastest Fourier transform in the west, version 3 or more
  (http://www.fftw.org/),

- GSL, The GNU scientific library, version 1.4 or more
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),

- if you want to install the demo you need a GLUT implementation, like
  freeglut (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).

You have to install the single-precision version of the FFTWF library
("--enable-float" flag of the configure script). To check if you have it
installed on your system, look for library files named “libfftw3f.so”.


For now, there is no “configure” installation script.

Edit the “user configuration” part of the file “config.mk” as you need and
type “make”.

The library can be found as libaqua/libaqua.so and the OpenGL demo (if you
have compiled it) as demo/aqua-demo.
