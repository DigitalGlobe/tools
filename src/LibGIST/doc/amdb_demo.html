This document will give you a quick tour of the features of amdb. To
begin, first install <A HREF="install.html"> amdb v.1.0 </A>.
Then proceed with the demo.

<hr>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

Amdb is a design tool for access methods (AMs) implemented with
libgist v.2.0. It includes debugging functionality for stepping
through individual tree commands such as insert, search, and
delete. Amdb also has tools for visualizing analysis metrics and
inspecting the state of the index at various levels. In this version,
the performance metrics are computed offline using
<tt>gistcmdline</tt> which takes a query workload and an existing
index as input. The metrics characterize the performance of each
query, the tree structure, and the structure shaping methods:
pickSplit() and penalty() of the implementation. These features enable
an AM designer to set up "what if" scenarios for pinpointing
implementation flaws, and analyze the workload performance of an AM to
identify deficiencies in the design.

<p> In this demo, we will show you how to use amdb by constructing and
analyzing 2-dimensional R-trees. We will first show how to bulk-load
indices with <tt>gistcmdline</tt>, and then show how to navigate and
inspect their structure using amdb. Then we will show how to set
breakpoints and step through tree commands.
Finally, we will compare the range query performance of partially
insertion loaded 2-dimensional AMs: an R-tree versus an R*-tree. We
will show how to compute analysis metrics for a query workload
presented to these trees using <tt>gistcmdline</tt>. These metrics can
then be browsed and visualized in the context of the search tree using
amdb.

<p> This demo will require about 5 MB of scratch space. Moreover, the
final analysis portion of the demo only has been tested on Sparc
Solaris platforms since it requires the use of <A
HREF="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/hmetis/main.shtml">hMETIS</A>.

<hr>

<h2> Bulk-Loading an Index </h2>

We begin by showing how to create a bulk-loaded R-tree using
<tt>gistcmdline</tt>, a command-line driver program for creating and
querying libgist indices as well as performing batch analysis
operations on them.

<p> First, we will need a data file containing the points we want to
place in the leaf level of the R-tree. We have provided two example
data files <tt>2d-uni-40000</tt> and <tt>2d-clust-2500</tt> in the
<tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory containing 40,000 uniformly
distributed and 2,500 clustered (100 uniformly distributed centers
each with 25 points clustered around them) 2-d point-value pairs
respectively.  Each line of the file contains a single point-value
pair formatted as <tt>"coor1 coor2 ..."  "value"</tt>. A sample from
one of the files is shown below.

<pre>
...
"7.80455 4.80426" "155"
"5.36057 4.84116" "155"
"10.4321 4.85839" "155"
"9.1856 4.91932" "155"
...
</pre>

<p> Make the driver program <tt>gistcmdline</tt> accessible from your
PATH variable; it is located under <tt>libgist/src/cmdline</tt>.
Start <tt>gistcmdline</tt> from the <tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory
and type <tt>help</tt>. It should provide a summary of the commands
and libgist extensions <tt>gistcmdline</tt> supports.

<p> The <tt>create</tt> command is used to create and bulk-load an
index. Type (or run <tt>build-script</tt> in the <tt>amdb-demo</tt> directory,
if you already know how to use <tt>gistcmdline</tt>)

<pre>libgist> create rt-2-uni rt_point_ext 2d-uni-40000 1.0</pre>

to create a point R-tree index, <tt>rt-2-uni</tt>, bulk-loaded with
point-value pairs from the <tt>2d-uni-40000</tt> data file using 100%
fill-factor for the leaf pages. The program returns to the standard
output the point-value pairs loaded into the index. You can turn off
this output by typing

<pre>libgist> set echo 0 </pre>

Likewise, create an R-tree and R*-tree index for the clustered
distribution of points. These two indicies will be used in the
analysis section of the demo.

<pre>libgist> create rt-2-clust rt_point_ext 2d-clust-2500 1.0</pre>

<pre>libgist> create rs-2-clust rstar_point_ext 2d-clust-2500 1.0 </pre>

<p> Exit <tt>gistcmdline</tt> by typing <tt>quit</tt>.  The commands
should have created three index files <tt>rt-2-uni</tt>,
<tt>rt-2-clust</tt>, and <tt>rs-2-clust</tt> in the
<tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory.

<p> The data items in the data files are sorted in the order the leaf
level pages are to be filled. The bulk-loading routine simply scans
the input file and places data items into leaf pages as they appear,
creating internal pages as necessary. Carriage returns in the data
file force the bulk-loading routine to begin filling a new leaf
page. The leaf and internal pages are packed as close as possible to
the specified fill-factor. The points in the example files are
arranged so as to fill the leaf pages according to the STR technique
[1] which partitions the data points into iso-oriented tiles.

<p> Note, indices can be created in other ways as well. One can
insertion load an index through <tt>gistcmdline</tt> or through
<tt>amdb</tt>. Indices can be created by other programs which call the
libgist library routines. Amdb can be used to inspect, debug, and
analyze any index created with libgist.

<hr>

<h2>Inspecting and Debugging an Index </h2>

Now that we have created some indices we can demonstrate some of the
visualization and debugging features of amdb. These features are
useful for browsing the structure and contents of a search tree on a
variety of scales while the stepping through canonical AM commands.
The visualization tools include a global summary of the tree, a
structural view, and a visualization of the node contents. We begin
with a demonstration of these views and then describe the debugging
features.

<p> Start amdb from <tt>amdb/src</tt> directory by typing <tt>gmake
run</tt>. (Remember to have the LIBGISTHOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variables set correctly, see <A HREF="install.html"> installation </A>
instructions). Amdb should appear containing an empty <b>Console</b>
window. 

<p> Open the R-tree filled with uniformly distributed 2-d points by
selecting <b>Open</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, and selecting
<tt>rt-2-uni</tt> in the file chooser. You will have to change
directories and find the index file. Go up two levels by clicking
twice on the <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/folder.gif" ALIGN=CENTER> icon. Then double
click on the <tt>doc</tt> directory, double click on <tt>demo</tt>,
and finally double click on <tt>rt-2-uni</tt>.

<h3> Tree View </h3>

<p> A window named <b>Tree View</b> should appear showing a white box
labelel with a "1" representing the root node of the opened index (You
may have to move the <b>Console</b> window). <b>Tree View</b> is a
visualization tool for exploring the structure of the index. It allows
you to navigate and examine various paths and subtrees of interest
within an overwhelming high-fanout search tree.

<p> Let's explore the index structure starting from the root
node. Click on the root node. Clicking on a node "open"s it and
displays a container below it, connected by a line, containing its
children. The display should show the root node has two children,
nodes 227 and 228. Each node is labeled with a number for
reference. Click on node 227. Notice the container holding the
children of node 227 has a scrollbar on top. Since node 227 has a high
fan-out, not all of its children can be displayed at once given the
screen space. Thus, the scrollbar can be used to scroll through the
children of node 227. 

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/treeview.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> Clicking on an "open" node will close the subtree shown below
it. Try clicking on the root node again. 

<p> If nothing happens when you click on node, then that node is a
leaf node. For example, node 2 is a leaf node. Play around with
<b>Tree View</b> until you feel comfortable with its operation. Note
<b>Tree View</b> is resizeable and scrollable in case the explored
paths and subtrees cannot fit within the window.

<h3> Node View and Contents </h3>

<p> Once you have found an individual node of interest with <b>Tree
View</b>, amdb allows you to visualize or dump its contents. Right
click on node 3, and from the popup menu select <b>Node View</b>. A
window should appear titled <b>Subtree View: 3 : all</b>. This window
displays the points contained in node 3 and can be resized as
desired. You can also view the contents of a subtree below a specific
node. For example, right click on the root node, and select <b>Subtree
View - 2</b>. A window tilted <b>Subtree View: 1 : 2</b> should appear
showing the contents of all nodes in the subtree of height 2 from (and
including) the root node and below. Thus, it shows the bounding
rectangles of the children of nodes 1, 227, and 228. For further
clarification of the items displayed in the subtree views, you can use
the highlight options.

<p> Right click on node 228, and select <b>Subtree View - 1</b> to see
the contents of node 228. Again, right click on node 228, and select
<b>Highlight Subtree - Subtree View: 1 : 2</b>. This should highlight
all the bounding rectangles and data items within the nodes below (and
including) node 228 that are rendered in the selected subtree view,
<b>Subtree View: 1 : 2</b>. Note the items highlighted in <b>Subtree
View: 1 : 2</b> are the bounding rectangle of node 228 and the
contents of node 228, as shown in <b>Subtree View: 228 : 1</b>.

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/highsub.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> Middle clicking or right clicking and selecting <b>Highlight
Path</b> on node 3 will highlight the path from the root to node 3. If
any subtree view is displaying the bounding rectangle of a node along
the highlighted path, then the rectangle within the view will be
highlighted. Using the highlightling features, you can figure out
which bounding rectangles correspond to which nodes. Play around with
the <b>Subtree View</b> and highlight options until you feel
comfortable with their operation.

<i> <p> A word of caution is necessary concerning the <b>Subtree
View</b> option. Currently, if the subtree visualized includes more
than 30 nodes, refreshing the subtree view can become terribly slow
causing amdb to appear to be hung. As a rule of thumb, do not open
subtree views of depth higher than 1 or 2. </i>

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/nodeview.gif">

<p> With node view you can also visualize how the contents of a node
might be separated when it splits. Right click on node 3 and select
<b>Highlight Split</b>. In <b>Subtree View: 3: all</b>, data items
will be highlighted to show the split. Such a visualization is
immediately useful for debugging the pickSplit() method. The node and
subtree views are user extensible so that they can be used for a
variety of data types.

<p> Finally, the <b>Node Contents</b> option gives a textual dump of
the contents of a node. Right click on any node and select that
option. Play around with these features until you feel comfortable.

<h3>Global View</h3>

Amdb also offers a global perspective on the index structure, called
<b>Global View</b> to visualize the variation of a statistic across
the tree as a whole. 

<p> Select <B>Show Global View</b> from the <b>Navigate</b> menu in
<b>Tree View</b>; then select <b>Tile All</b> from the <b>Align</b>
menu. A window titled <b>Global View</b> should appear. It projects
the entire tree onto a triangle whose base is adjustable via the
slider at the top and whose height is adjusted by resizing the
<b>Global View</b> window. Select <b>Slot Count</b> from the <b>Tree
Stats</b> menu and adjust the slider to about 1/4 of the total. The
slot counts of the nodes are depicted by color. (These colors can be
changed by choosing <b>Choose Palette</b> from the <b>File</b> menu in
<b>Tree View</b>. Extra palettes are in the
<tt>libgist\etc\palette</tt> directory.)  The colors map to the
relevant statistic according to the color scale on the left side of
<b>Tree View</b>. You can click on an area of interest in the global
view and a path to the closest node will be displayed in the tree
view.

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/globalview.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> The utility of this view is best demonstrated when trying to
visualize the analysis metrics, so we postpone a detailed discussion
until later.

<h3> Debugging Functionality </h3>

Now that we have learned how to browse the tree structure, it will be
useful when we want to observe the change of the index structure after
issuing access method commands: insert, search, and delete. Amdb
allows you execute these commands on a selected index and manually
step through them with the aid of breakpoints on various node-oriented
events.  Similar to a programming language debugger, these features
allow a designer to setup scenarios and trace an operation to pinpoint
flaws in an AM implementation. We now demonstrate how to use these
features.

<p> First, we will show how to issue AM commands with amdb by
executing a nearest neighbor search on the R-tree which indexes the
clustered distribution. Open the <tt>rt-2-uni</tt> index if it is not
already opened. From the <b>Ops</b> menu select <b>Search</b>. In the
dialog box that pops up, type <tt>~ p 46 46</tt> in the <b>Query</b>
field and type <tt>10</tt> in the <b>Retrival Limit</b>.  This finds
the 10 nearest neighbors of the point (46,46). The results will appear
in the <b>Console</b> window. Similarly, you can insert into and
delete from the index.

<p> To suspend execution of a command and step through it we first
need to set a breakpoint on some event. There are several types of
node-oriented events that amdb generates. We will set a breakpoint on
the traversal of the root and step through the search we executed
above.

<p> Go to the <b>Debug</b> menu and select <b>Breakpoints</b>. A
dialog window should appear. Create a new breakpoint by selecting
<b>New</b>; a new breakpoint with <b>ID</b>=0 should appear. The
<b>Event</b> column specifies the event on which breakpoint is
triggered, and the <b>Node</b> column associates the event with a
particular node or all node if unspecified. Select <b>Node
Traversal</b> in the <b>Event</b> column and type <b>1</b> in the
<b>Node</b> column to set a breakpoint on the traversal of the
root. Click <b>Ok</b> to register the new breakpoint. 

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/breakpoint.gif">

<p> Now reexecute the previous search to find 10 nearest neighbors of
the point (46,46). The <b>Step</b> and <b>Continue</b> controls under
the menu bar should be enabled, and the root node should be
highlighted. <b>Step</b> allows you to move from event to event while
<b>Continue</b> moves the search to the next breakpoint. <b>Step</b>
through the search. <b>Tree View</b> should highlight the path to the
current node and the <b>Console</b> window should give you a status of
your progress. This search will visit the following nodes: 1, 227, 98,
114, and 113.

<p> Amdb conveniently permits breakpoints on many different
node-oriented actions to avoid stepping through tediously long
commands. Go to the breakpoint table once again and create a new
breakpoint on an <b>Item Insertion</b> event (remember to hit
<b>Ok</b>). Open a <b>Node Contents</b> and <b>Node View</b> window
for node 3. From the <b>Ops</b> menu select <b>Insert</b> and type
<tt>0.05 7.0</tt> in the <b>Key</b> field and <tt>1999</tt> in the
<b>Data</b> field. Click on <b>Ok</b>.  This command will insert a new
point (0.05, 7.0) located in the lower left hand corner of <b>Subtree
View: 3 : all</b>. Using <b>Step</b> would trace the insertion step by
step, but since we want to jump directly to that point, click
<b>Continue</b>. This takes us directly to the next breakpoint event
which is an insertion. The <b>Console</b> window will indicate that an
item is ready to be inserted in node 3 and a path to it will be
highlighted in <b>Tree View</b>. Use <b>Step</b> to complete the
insertion, and note the node contents and node view for node 3 will
reflect the change (a point in the lower left corner will appear in
the node view).

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/debug.gif">

<p> These debugging and visualization features aid in finding bugs in
the AM implementation, but offer little information into the
performance characteristics of the AM desgin. Amdb analysis features
provide such insight for a specific query workload.

<hr>

<h2> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/warning.gif" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="89"> Performance Analysis </h2>

Amdb provides a breakdown of the I/Os required to perform a query
workload into the performance relevant characteristics of an AM:
clustering, utilization, and excess coverage. These metrics when
projected onto the search tree using the visualization tools can help
identify sources of deficiencies in the AM design. The analysis phase
consists of two steps: computing the analysis metrics and browsing and
examining the results in the context of the search tree. Since
computing the analysis can be time consuming task, we perform this
offline using <tt>gistcmdline</tt>. We then explain how to view the
workload metrics with amdb.

<h3> Creating an AM Workload Analysis</h3>

We will collect the analysis statistics for a query workload presented
to the R-tree and R*-tree containing the clustered distribution using
<tt>gistcmdline</tt>. 

<p> First, we need complete the construction of the R-trees by
inserting 2,500 more points from the same distribution. We have
provided two files <tt>2d-clust-ins.rt</tt> and
<tt>2d-clust-ins.rs</tt> which contain commands to insert the extra
2,500 points in <tt>rt-2-clust</tt> and <tt>rs-2-clust</tt>. Take a
look at the files if you are curious. Then execute the following from
the <tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory.

<pre> amdb/doc/demo> gistcmdline < 2d-clust-ins.rt </pre>
<pre> amdb/doc/demo> gistcmdline < 2d-clust-ins.rs </pre>

<p> To compute the analysis, we need a couple of input data files.
First, we need a query workload. A sample workload can be found in
<tt>2d-clust-queries</tt> in the <tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory. It
contains square containment queries centered on the points from the
clustered distribution. For the analysis of the penalty() method,
which guides the insertion routine for GiST trees, we need a set of
candidate keys that could be inserted. The <tt>2d-100.keys</tt> file
in the <tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory contains an example of a
hundred candidate keys.

<p> The script files <tt>rt-clust-anl.scr</tt> and
<tt>rs-clust-anl.scr</tt> contain a sequence of commands to
<tt>gistcmdline</tt> which will create analyses for the respective
search trees using the queries in <tt>2d-clust-queries</tt> and the
keys in <tt>2d-100.keys</tt>. To compute some of the analysis metrics,
<tt>gistcmdline</tt> requires the use of <A
HREF="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/hmetis/main.shtml">hMETIS</A>
to generate an optimal clustering of data items withing leaf pages.
Thus, before we do anything, make sure <tt>hmetis</tt> is accessible
from the PATH variable. Then execute the following from the
<tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory.

<pre> amdb/doc/demo> gistcmdline < rt-clust-anl.scr </pre>
<pre> amdb/doc/demo> gistcmdline < rs-clust-anl.scr </pre>

Each of these will take several minutes to compute. Once completed,
two analysis files <tt>rt-2-clust-anl</tt> and <tt>rs-2-clust-anl</tt>
will be created in the <tt>amdb/doc/demo</tt> directory. They contain
a snapshot of the respective index at the time the analysis was
generated, profiling information from the workload, and the analysis
metrics.

<h3> Analysis Metrics </h3>

The analyses computed above assess the performance of an AM in terms
of I/Os. There are three parts to each analysis. The workload metrics
characterize the query workload and tree structure in terms of search
tree performance factors. The second two parts, split and penalty
metrics, assess the quality of the structure-shaping methods of the
AM, pickSplit() and penalty(), which guide splits and insertions. We
discuss each of these metrics in turn.

<h4> Workload Metrics</h4>

The workload metrics categorize the additional I/Os (as compared to
the workload-optimal tree) needed to perform the query workload into
losses due to factors which effect access method performance. The
factors are clustering, utlization, and excess coverage of bounding
predicates. The losses are computed for the entire workload and broken
down for individual queries and individual nodes. Let's take a look at
the workload metrics we computed the R-tree and the R*-tree.

<p> Start amdb, if not already started, and select <b>Open
Analysis</b> from the <b>Analysis</b> menu. Open the
<tt>rt-2-clust-anl</tt> analysis for the R-tree. (Again you will have
to go up two levels, and into the <tt>doc/demo</tt> directory). Start
another amdb, and open the <tt>rs-2-clust-anl</tt> analysis for the
R*-tree. In both amdb sessions, open the workload stats dialog by
selecting <b>Workload Stats ...</b> from the <b>Analysis</b>
menu. This dialog intially shows the parameters of the analysis we
computed, the number of queries, the target utilization we specified
(80%), etc. Click on the <b>Leaves</b> tab in both dialog boxes.

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/wkld-rt.gif" ALIGN=CENTER> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/wkld-rs.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> The dialog boxes should look similar to the ones shown above. The
left one contains the workload statistics for the R-tree and the right
one is contains the statistics for the R*-tree. For the purposes of
this demo, we will explain what some of the metrics to get an idea of
their utility but we will spare you the details of every number shown.

<p> The metrics currently shown are the aggregate measures for the
entire query workload. Since the <b>Leaves</b> tab is selected, these
metrics only consider the I/Os performed for the leaf level pages of
the search tree. The left <b>I/Os</b>column indicates the number of
I/Os for each of the categories, while the right <b>Overhead</b>
column shows the ratio in comparison to the workload-optimal tree. The
<b>Actual Clustering</b> category (bottom) inidicates the number of
leaf level I/Os perfomed for the tree for the query workload. The
<b>Optimal Clustering</b> indicates the number of I/Os required at the
leaf level if the data items were optimally clustered into the leaf
pages, i.e. it corresponds to an acheivable minimum. The optimal
clustering is computed using hMETIS. The <b>Excess Coverage Loss</b>
indicates the number of I/Os performed at the leaf level which
returned no items. These empty accesses are due to the excess coverage
of the bounding predicates (BPs) of the leaf pages. Note, the R-tree
has a much higher excess coverage loss than the R*-tree indicating
that the latter's BPs do a better job of describing the data in the
leaf pages. Since both trees use MBRs for the BPs, this means that
this advantage is simply due to better placement of data items into
leaf pages leading to less overlap. That is, the R*-tree should have
better clustering.

<p> The remaining I/Os (actual - exc. cov.) are used to compute the
clustering and utilization loss. The <b>Clustering Loss</b> is the
number of additional I/Os performed over the optimal clustering, if
the accessed pages had been packed to the target utilization of 80%.
After removing the clustering loss, the remaining additional I/Os
performed (actual - exc.cov - clust. loss - opt. clust), are due to
under utilization of the leaf nodes; thus, it is the <b>Utilizaiton
Loss</b>. The sum of the optimal clustering and the losses should add
up to the actual I/Os performed. Note, the R*-tree does do a better
job of clustering co-retrieved data items than the R-tree.

<p> The <b>Internal/Totals</b> section shows the metrics for the
internal levels of the search tree. We cannot compute the
<b>Clustering Loss</b> for the internal levels, but the <b>Excess
Coverage</b> and <b>Utilization</b> losses are shown.

<p> The workload metrics are futher broken down for each node in the
tree and for each query. To see the metrics projected onto the search
tree, you simply need to select the appropriate metric from the
options in <b>Display</b> list on the <b>Workload Statistics</b>
dialog. Select <b>Excess Coverage Loss</b> from the <b>Display</b> tab
for the R-tree. Now open up the <b>Global View</b> from the
<b>Navigate Menu</b> in <b>Tree View</b> and select <b>Tile All</b>
from the <b>Align</b> menu. In the global view, set the slider all the
way to the right.

<p> Notice that one leaf node has an unusually high excess coverage
loss; it is colored white. Click on that area in the <b>Global
View</b> and the <b>Tree View</b> will show a path to node 18. Open a
node view on the root node (only one level). Notice, node 18 has high
overlap with another bounding rectangle, which happens to be for node
10. Open node views on node 18 and node 10. You will find that node 18
has one outlier which makes its MBR large, empty, and overlapping with
node 10, causing the high excess coverage loss. Play around with other
metrics. The <b>Global View</b> in combination with the metrics dialog
is useful for "drilling down" and finding causes of performance losses
which may lead to insights into design flaws. 

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/exc-loss.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> The metrics can also be visualized on a per query basis by
selecting the <b>Queries</b> radio button on the <b>Workload
Statistics</b> dialog and selecting the appropriate query in the
field. Once you are finished, select <b>Quit</b> to exit the dialog.

<h4> Split and Penalty Metrics </h4>

The split metrics assess the quality of the pickSplit() method. Each
leaf page is split according to the pickSplit() method and compared
with the optimal split in terms of the projected query workload. The
projected workload is simply one which considers the queries which
retrieve data items from the page in question. The improvement (or
deterioration) in performance is recorded on a per leaf basis and
summarized for all the leaves.

<p>Select <b>Split Stats ...</b> from the <b>Analysis</b> menu for
both the R-tree and the R*-tree. (<i> if that does not work, select
<b>Workload Stats ...</b> and quit from the <b>Workload Statistics</b>
dialog. Apologies for the bug.</i>) They should look similar to the
following (R-tree on left and R*-tree on right).

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/split-rt.gif" ALIGN=CENTER> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/split-rs.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> Notice the aggregate clustering loss for the R*-tree splits is
much lower than that of the R-tree splits (and hence the higher
success rate). This indicates that the pickSplit() method of the
R*-tree is at least partially responsible for the improvement in
clustering for the given query workload.

<p> The penalty metrics assess the quality of the penalty() method.
Each candidate key is inserted into the tree top-down and compared
with the optimal insertion (again in the context of the query
workload).  In terms of excess coverage, the optimal insertion is the
one which results in no excess coverage, so the point of comparison is
0 excess coverage. In terms of clustering loss, the optimal insertion
is one which minimizes the added clustering loss.  Likewise, the
difference in performance is recorded on a per candidate key basis and
summarized for all leaves.

<p> Select <b>Penalty Stats ...</b> from the <b>Analysis</b> menu for
both the R-tree and the R*-tree. They should look similar to the
following (R-tree on left and R*-tree on right).

<p> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/penalty-rt.gif" ALIGN=CENTER> <IMG SRC="amdb-demo-gifs/penalty-rs.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>

<p> Notice, for the candidate key insertions, the clustering did not
change much for either tree. However, the excess coverage loss is
better for the R*-tree that the R-tree. This indicates the insertion
guiding routine for R*-tree is better for the given workload/candidate
key set combination.

<hr>

<p> You should now be familiar with the capabilities of amdb. More
detailed descriptions of the features and metrics are available in the
user manual. Finally, there is a paper available off the 
 <A HREF="http://gist.cs.berkeley.edu">GiST</A> web site which justifies
the basis of the analysis framework and explains how the analysis is
computed.
