// commonly-needed derived metadata.  they are only generated and used
// when we need to compute on the predicates; since they are generally
// produced on-demand, and possibly repeatedly, we need to be able to
// do so efficiently.  hence, we typically provide two constructor
// interfaces: one that allocates a new chunk of memory and one that
// does not.
