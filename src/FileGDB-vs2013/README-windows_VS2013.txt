SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
      Visual Studio 2013 SP1 (C++) Premium, Professional, Ultimate or Team Editions required for development.
      Visual Studio 2013 C and C++ Runtimes required for deployment.
      .NET 4.5.1 Framework is required for the .NET wrapper.

TO BUILD THE SAMPLES ON WINDOWS 32-bit:
        C++
	1) Open Visual Studio.
        2) Open the samples project (FileGDB_API\samples\samples_VS2013.sln).
        3) In the solution explorer, right click on the solution (the top of the tree) and 
        select "Rebuild Solution". The samples will begin to build. Ignore all warnings. You will
        see a failure in the Display sample. It requires that you install GLUT. You will also see a
        failure in the ProcessTopologies sample which requires that you install libXml.

        Note: GLUT can be downloaded from: http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/
        Download the pre-compiled version of GLUT or the source and compile it yourself. The 
        GLUT README included instruction on how to compile the source. To install GLUT unzip 
        the GLUT zip file onto your local disk. Depending on where you install GLUT you may
        have to modify the project include and library directory paths and dependencies. You
        will need to copy the glut32.dll to the bin (samples\bin) directory.
        
        Note: If you get linker errors such as "LNK2026: module unsafe for SAFESEH image" when 
        building the Display sample, open the project settings under Linker -> Advanced and set
        Image Has Safe Exception Handlers to No (/SAFESEH:NO).

        libXml can be downloaded from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html. Depending on where 
        you install libXml you may have to modify the project include and library directory 
        paths and dependencies.  New versions of libXml may have additional dependencies such 
        as iconv.dll and zlib.dll.  These other dependencies can be downloaded at the same 
        location as libXml.

        C#
	1) Open Visual Studio.
        2) Open the samples project (FileGDB_API\samplesC#\samplesCsharp_VS2013.sln).
        3) In the solution explorer, right click on the solution (the top of the tree) and 
        select "Rebuild Solution". The samples will begin to build. Ignore all warnings. You will
        see a failure in the Display sample. It requires that you install OpenTK. 

        Note: OpenTK can be downloaded from: http://www.opentk.com/
        

TO BUILD THE SAMPLES ON WINDOWS 64-bit:
        C++
        1) Open Visual Studio.
        2) Open the samples project (FileGDB_API\samples\samples_VS2013.sln).
        3) Change the Solution Platform to x64.
        4) In the solution explorer, right click on the solution (the top of the tree) and 
        select "Rebuild Solution". The samples will begin to build. Ignore all warnings. You will
        see a failure in the Display sample. It requires that you install GLUT. You will also see a
        failure in the ProcessTopologies sample which requires that you install libXml.

        Note: GLUT64 can be downloaded from the web. Depending on where you install GLUT64 you may
        have to modify the project include and library directory paths and dependencies. You
        will need to copy the glut64.dll to the bin (samples\bin64) directory.
        
        Note: If you get linker errors such as "LNK2026: module unsafe for SAFESEH image" when 
        building the Display sample, open the project settings under Linker -> Advanced and set
        Image Has Safe Exception Handlers to No (/SAFESEH:NO).

        libXml can be downloaded from http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html. Depending on where 
        you install libXml you may have to modify the project include and library directory 
        paths and dependencies.  New versions of libXml may have additional dependencies such 
        as iconv.dll and zlib.dll.  These other dependencies can be downloaded at the same 
        location as libXml.

        C#
	1) Open Visual Studio.
        2) Open the samples project (FileGDB_API\samplesC#\samplesCsharp_VS2013.sln).
        3) Change the Solution Platform to x64.
        4) In the solution explorer, right click on the solution (the top of the tree) and 
        select "Rebuild Solution". The samples will begin to build. Ignore all warnings. You will
        see a failure in the Display sample. It requires that you install OpenTK.

SAMPLES:

C++

To access the html help open FileGDB_API\doc\html\index.html in a web browser.

The samples directory contains C++ samples that demonstrate various aspects 
of the API. A MS Visual Studio 2012 Solution and Projects are included for 
all. The XMLsamples directory provides example XML for creating tables, feature
classes, feature datasets, indexes, subtypes, and domains. The display sample 
requires that GLUT 3.7.6 be installed. 
http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/

The include directory contains the required include files plus a convenience 
include, FileGDBAPI.h, which references all of the others.

C#

To access the html help open FileGDB_API\doc\htmlC#\index.html in a web browser.

The samples directory contains C# samples that demonstrate various aspects 
of the API. A MS Visual Studio 2012 Solution and Projects are included for 
all. The display sample requires that OpenTK be installed.

SUPPORTED:
    * Create, Open and Delete file geodatabases
    * Read the schema of the geodatabase
          o All content within a geodatabase can be opened for read access
    * Create schema for objects within the simple feature model
          o Tables
          o Point, Line, and Polygon feature classes
          o Feature datasets
          o Domains
          o Subtypes

    * Read the contents of datasets in a geodatabase
          o All dataset content within a geodatabase can be read
    * Insert, Delete and Edit the contents of simple datasets:
          o Tables
          o Point, Line, Polygon, Multipoint, and Multipatch feature classes 
    * Perform attribute and (limited) spatial queries on datasets
          o Spatial queries will be limited to the envelope-intersects operator
	* Version 10.x file geodatabases only, previous versions cannot be opened.

NOT SUPPORTED:

While the Esri File Geodatabase API supports reading the schema and data of complex geodatabase types, the API does not honor geodatabase behavior on inserts, deletes or updates to the following dataset types:

    * Annotation and Dimension feature classes
    * Relationship Classes
    * Networks (GN and ND)
    * Topologies
    * Terrains
    * Representations
    * Parcel Fabrics

In most cases the API will prevent users from attempting to edit objects with complex behavior, but the onus is on the developer to understand what they should and should not edit through the API and avoid editing datasets that have geodatabase behavior. 

Other limitations of the Esri File Geodatabase API:

    * Rasters (Raster Dataset, Raster Catalog, Mosaic Datasets and Raster Attributes) are not supported.
    * Spatial queries with the File Geodatabase API are limited to the envelope-intersects operator.
    * Vertical Datums are not supported.	
    * The API is not thread safe.
    
WHAT'S NEW:

	* Support for reading Compressed fgdb data.. (NIM071731)
	* Custom projection support. (NIM073951)
	* non-XML creation of tables.
	* The field list is now honored on Searches, only returning the requested fields. (NIM082242)
	* Upgrade to libxlt (1.1.28) to pickup fix for memory leak. (NIM098151)
	* Added Compact geodatabase (NIM098323).
	* MS Visual Studio 2013 support.
	
KNOWN ISSUES:

    * Concurrent access from Windows and Linux clients to the same File GeoDatabase can corrupt data. This combination should be avoided.
    * SQL joins are not supported.

FIXED ISSUES:

NIM071731 Add support for Compressed Data File. (Read Only)
NIM073951 Request to support custom spatial references with the File Geodatabase API.
NIM082242 ENH: File Geodatabase API (v1.2) executeSQL should honor SELECT statement's nominated field list, in the returned EnumRows object, instead of all fields.
NIM084105 MultiPartShapeBuffer::GetMs return the wrong pointer value 
NIM085366 Using only a null or empty geometry results in a invalid extent.
NIM085995 Using ExecuteSQL with an ORDER BY on a text field fails on MacOS
NIM098151 Table.GetDefinition function leaks memory
NIM098225 CloseGeodatabase hangs on 64-bit if same gdb opened more than once
NIM098322 Getter/setter functions by name need to be optimized for sequential search across the column selection list.
NIM099041 Some apparently valid XML feature class definitions create tables that fail on export and copy/paste.
